# Decision_Tree
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree algorithm to perform predictive analysis using supervised machine learning. The model is built to understand decision-making logic by learning patterns from historical data and representing them in a tree-like structure.
# Key Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning

* Feature selection and splitting

* Decision Tree model training

* Model evaluation using accuracy and performance metrics

* Visualization of the decision tree for better interpretability
# Technologies Used

* Python

* Pandas & NumPy

* Scikit-learn

* Matplotlib / Seaborn

# Use Cases

* Classification problems

* Business decision analysis

* Risk assessment

* Predictive modeling
